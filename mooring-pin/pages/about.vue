            <p class="mb-4">
              Mooring Pin was born from a passion for canal boat living and the need for a better way to find marinas. It all started when Matt, one of our co-founders, decided to embrace the boat life and move onto a canal boat. As he navigated the waterways, he quickly realized how challenging it could be to find marinas with the specific services he needed.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Matt shared his experiences with his long-time friend and fellow web developer, and together they saw an opportunity to create something truly useful for the canal boat community. They combined their web development skills with Matt's firsthand knowledge of life on the water to build Mooring Pin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is simple: to make life easier for canal boat enthusiasts by providing an easy-to-use platform to find and book marinas with the exact services they need, wherever their journey takes them.
